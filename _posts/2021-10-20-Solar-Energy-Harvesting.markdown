# Energy harvesting is by no means a new idea...
These ultralow power solutions can be used in a wide array of wireless systems, including transportation infrastructure, medical devices, tire pressure sensing, industrial sensing, building automation and asset tracking. These systems generally spend the majority of their operational lives in standby mode asleep requiring only a handful of ÂµW. When awakened, a sensor measures parameters such as pressure, temperature or mechanical deflection and then transmits this data to a remote control system wirelessly. The entire measurement, processing and transmission time is usually only tens of milliseconds, but may require hundreds of mW of power for this brief period.
